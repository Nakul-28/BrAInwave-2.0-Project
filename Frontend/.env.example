# Environment Configuration Template
#
# This project uses MapLibre GL JS (open-source) which does NOT require API tokens.
# No environment variables are currently needed for development.
#
# If you switch to Mapbox GL JS in the future, add:
# VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
#
# For production deployment, configure:
# VITE_BACKEND_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
# VITE_ENV=production
